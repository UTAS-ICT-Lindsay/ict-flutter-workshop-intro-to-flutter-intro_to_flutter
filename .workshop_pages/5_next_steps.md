# 5. What to Learn Next

There is a lot more to learn about Flutter! Here are some suggestions for what to learn next:
- Check out **Luke's repository** from this GDG event: [TODO Link](#)
  - I've also put his sample code in [`/lib/5_luke_sample`](/lib/5_luke_sample), which you can execute by changing the import in `lib/main.dart` to:
  ```dart
    import 'package:intro_to_flutter/5_luke_sample/main.dart';
    ```

- For a more detailed introduction to Flutter, check out the official Google **Codelab**: [Flutter Codelab: Your first Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first)

- Take **[KIT305](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kit305-mobile-application-development) or [KIT721](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kit721-mobile-application-development) Mobile Application Development** at the University of Tasmania, which covers Flutter in detail.
